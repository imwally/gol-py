# Conway's Game of Life

More of a prototype sketch to get a better understanding of how Conway's Game of
Life translates to code. It's not very elegant and I'm sure there's more
efficient and concise ways of writing it but it works.

This simply clears and rewrites to the terminal buffer each time the board is
updated. It uses the [large black square](https://unicode-table.com/en/2B1B/)
Unicode character 'U+2B1B' (⬛️) to display a live cell.
